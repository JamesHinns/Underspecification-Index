# Underspecification-Index
Quantifying Underspecification by evaluating SHAP explanation variance across Rashomon sets.

## Sample Notebooks

[Bike Share Example](Bikeshare_Example.ipynb)
Shows the stratified evaluations we use to validate underspecification indexes capture the
expected relationship they aim to model.

[Software Realisation Notebook](Software_Realisation.ipynb)
A notebook to support chapters 7 and 8 of the thesis, showing the initial and optimised 
implementations of the proposed method. The final iterations of these files can 
be found in the [underspecification index folder](underspecification_index)
